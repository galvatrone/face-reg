# FaceReg

A small project for face recognition.

Installation:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run:

```bash
python NeurMain.py
```

Structure:
- `faces/` — folder with images for training/testing
- `models/` — saved models
- `NeurMain.py` — main launch script

If you'd like, I can supplement the README with detailed instructions on training and using the model.
